    "A hash table is a data structure which allows a user to look up a value within the data structure using a specific key. The value is stored at an index which is calculated by hashing the key. By calculating the hash based on the key, the index of the value is unique, and the index may be calculated again for lookup simply by passing the key to a hash function. This effectively allows a user to access the contents of the hash table without iterating over each value, meaning that the value may be retrieved much more quickly than if it were stored in an array alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables come with their own set of problems to solve, however. The system falls apart if the index of one key/value pair is equivalent to the index of a completely different key/value pair. This problem, known as Collision, may be solved in a number of ways, though usually a combination of approaches is used. The hash function must generate sufficiently different indices for keys that are similar, and the hash table must have a way to deal with collisions when they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my implementation, I've chosen to use a collision algorithm known commonly as the \"separate chaining\" algorithm. In this implementation, the hash table actually stores a linked list at each index rather than the exact value on its own. If a collision arises, the colliding value is added on to the beginning of the linked list at that index. \n",
    "\n",
    "For my hash generation, I've chosen to take the key as input, convert each character in the key to its ASCII value, make each ascii value a digit (or series of digits) in a new number, and then perform mod division using a large prime number. This way, the index produced by hashing may be calculated quickly and the large prime number ensures that each index is sufficiently unique. \n",
    "\n",
    "As far as the O() behavior goes, accessing an index where there hasn't been a collision should take constant time, at least as much time as it takes to hash the index and then return the value at the hashed index. In the worst case, where the index has collided with another index that has been previously occupied, then the O() behavior of that retrieval would be closer to O(n), where n is the number of steps down the linked list to reach the desired value. I find the separate chaining algorithm to be more desirable than linear probing for this reason, as the worst case calculation for the linear probing algorithm, also O(n), is considerably more likely, and more difficult to handle as calculating the index of a particular entry that has been placed via linear probing requires extra calculation beyond the hashing function. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reviewing for this question, I read Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual, specifically section 3.3 on dictionaries (hash tables are dictionaries with hashing, essentially). I also read [these slides](https://study.cs50.net/hashtables) to get an idea of what kinds of collision algorithms were possible. "
