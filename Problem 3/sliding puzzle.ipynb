    "I understand how Breadth and Depth first search work, but I do not understand exactly what kind of strategy is needed to solve a sliding puzzle. I didn't think this was the kind of confusoin where I should ask for clarification, so I did not do so...\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that the puzzle must end up in row-major order... From watching [this gif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle#/media/File:Batgirl.gif), it seems like a good strategy might be to get the smallest value to root position and then begin rearranging from the top again. This would necessarily require moving the \"empty\" square to the top, then percolating it back down again. I also noticed that, in the solved puzzle, the left child's value is the value of the parent added to three, while the right child's value is the value of the parent added to one. \n",
