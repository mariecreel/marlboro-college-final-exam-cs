# Final Exam for Graduation with a Computer Science degree - Marlboro College
I completed this final exam as a degree requirement for graduating with a CS degree at Marlboro College. I earned an A- with these answers, and it took me a week to complete the exam.

## Original Language of the Exam Questions and Assignment, From Jim Mahoney

computer science plan exam : algorithms and languages

  * for Nick Creel (now Marie Creel)
  * from Jim Mahoney
  * out:    Fri April 10 2020
  * due:    midnight Fri April 17 2020

This is open take-home exam: books or web sources are OK as long as
the problem doesn't set other constraints, you cite them explicitly,
and that they aren't a drop-in solution to the problem. However, the
more your answer is a summary of someone else's article, the less we
will be impressed. Don't ask other people for help. Don't just give a
numerical result, give an explanation.  Your job is to convince us you
understand this stuff.

So in terms of a grading rubric, what you should think about is
 * technical merit - correctness & thoroughness of response
 * clarity of expression (including docs & tests for code)
 * demonstration of understanding (vs summarizing other's work)

As always with my exams, if you think there's a mistake in one of the
questions or it doesn't make sense, you can (a) ask for clarification,
and/or (b) make and state an explicit interpretation and do the
problem that way.  (Again: the point is to show your mastery,
not to get the "right answer" per se.)

Good luck.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. Describe and give specific examples of the various types
    of variable scope in python, javascript, and C. Explain what's
    similar and what's different between the languages.

 2. Implement, numerically test, and explain two different sorting
    algorithms with different O() behaviors on randomly chosen
    lists of numbers with various sizes n. Use two different
    programming languages and coding styles. Show graphically
    that the expecected performance is consistent with your
    numerical experiments.

 3. In a language of your choice, code and explain both a depth first
    and breadth first search algorithm of a tree for a small "sliding
    block" puzzle. (Using a stack and queue would be a good approach.)

    A sample search might be to get from 

         start        finish      

         2 1 3        1 2 3
         5 4 6        4 5 6
         7 8 .        7 8 .

    where the "." is the empty square and the two possible first moves 
    slide either the 6 or the 8 to bottom right corner.

 4. Explain what a "hash table" is, and what it's O() behavior looks
    like. Implement one and use it to make a histogram of a word
    counts in a large text file. The specifics (collision algorithm,
    hash function, programming language) are all up to you.

 5. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the Python, Javascript,
    and C programming languages as you see them. What sorts of
    problems or situations are good fits to these languages, and why?
    Which do you personally like, and why?  Be specific, giving
    code examples to make your comparisons and conclusions concrete.
